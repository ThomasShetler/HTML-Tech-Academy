    <h3>For i am a broken man, heart has gone missing for she ripped it out of my body</h3>
    <h3>I am nothing but a suite of flesh and bones, I am no longer a man but that of corpse that breaths</h3>
    <p class="god">You are not safe here, your god cannot help you, but rest assured, you shall be on your knees</p>
    <p class="god">You're not a man for you are scum upon my shoes. a pathetic site to see, how would you let another man be your undoing...</p>
    <h3> at lass, My pain can be taken away by the blade of another man so that I may not die of my own hand</h3>
    <p class="god">Fool, you're pain has only beguin.</p>
